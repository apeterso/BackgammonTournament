# BackgammonTournament
Every year my family hosts a large backgammon tournament. The tournament is structured around a "March Madness" style single elimination bracket. Given n participants, it's often difficult to construct the bracket. The bracket is especially difficult to build as participants drop out and get added in the days leading up to the tournament.

The task of constructing the bracket seemed like something that could be accomlished with software so this project aims to construct a single-elimination tournament bracket with n participants.
